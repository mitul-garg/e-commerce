# E-Commerce Website

A fully-functional E-Commerce website with the ability to receive payments and place orders using Commerce JS and Stripe.

## Overview

The Website is a <strong>Single Page Application</strong> providing E-Commerce functionalities using [Commerce JS](https://commercejs.com/) along with a simple UI built with [Material UI](https://mui.com/). The app is capable of viewing products, adding them to the cart, editing the cart, placing an order along with payment confirmation. The app is also ready to be integrated completely with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for receiving real-time payments and confirmation emails. The project helped me to use APIs in a better way, even with dynamically updating various components.
